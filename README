The rhxterm package provides two commands "\defineterm" and "\useterm"
in order to tag definitions and use of terms that are introduced by
the writer of some text.

If the hyperref package is loaded (after rhxterm) then also hyperlinks
from the use of some term to the place of its definition is generated.

Furthermore, the rhxterm package provides commands for the additional
definition of commands like \defineterm and \useterm.

The file rhxterm.sty.nw is a literate program, just say

  git clone git://github.com/hemmecke/rhxterm.git
  make rhxterm.dvi

in order to compile the source file into a dvi file.
This will require noweb and latex on your system.
